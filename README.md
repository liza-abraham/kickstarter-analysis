# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise has an ambitious goal of raising $12,000 to put on a play,

,in the US.

### Purpose
Our purpose is to identify the conditions most likely to result in a successful kickstarter campaign to put on the play, which is a genre of theater production.

## Analysis and Challenges
Data from 1369 theater productions was exammined to determine in which month the largest number of successful campaigns is launched. Of these theater productions, 1112 were plays, staged in any country. This subset of 1112 plays was examined to determine what percentage of plays within a certain budget were successful in reaching their fundraising goal.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analyzing the 1369 theater productions shows that May or June are the best months to launch a campaign. Examining data from 10 years (1970, and 2009-2017, inclusive) shows that 839 theater productions successfully reached their goal, and that 111 of these were launched in May, and an additional 100 were launched in June. In other words, about 25%, or one-quarter, of all successful theater campaigns are launched in May or June. Since the number of failed campaigns launched each month remains fairly flat throughout the year (ranging from 22 to 50), launching in May or June represents the highest probablity of a successful campaign, relative to failing. This data set could be strengthed and made more relevant by elminiting the data from 1970, which would create a smaller data set but may be more relevant to the current funding environment.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The budget range with the highest percentage of successful campaigns is $1,000 to $1,499. 73% of plays within this goal range are successfully fundeded, out of 534 projects. Plays with a budget of $40,000 to $45,999 also had a high rate of success at 67%, however this only included three plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Unfortunately, only 54% of plays with a goal in the $10,000 to $15,000 range are successful. To give

the best chance for coming to fruition, Louise should launch her kickstarter campaign in late spring or early summer (i.e., in May or June). Drilling down into the number of backers, and the amount of the average donation, for plays in the US, with a goal between $10,000 and $14,999, and launched in May and June, would be useful for identifying further goals for Louise's kickstarter.

For example: a quick analysis shows that of successfully-funded plays in any country that have a goal between $10,000 and $14,999 dollars - the modal number of backers is 72, with the number of backers in successful campaigns ranging from 62 to 199. The avearge donation across all camapaigns is approximately $112. This tells us that Louise needs to focus on finding at least 107 backers while maintaining an average donation of $112

Since the most number of backers any campaign has found is 199, Louise will want to focus on keeping donations over $60. Developing donor tiers at $75, $125, $250, and $500 would be avisable for Louise's ambitious goal.


## Results

- May and June are the months with the highest number of successful campaigns.
- The number of failed campaigns per month is overall flat throughout the year. 

- Overall, many plays are fully funded with a budget under $1,500. Louise's goal is many times this amount. Plays in her range are about even in terms of if they fail or succeed to reach their funding goal.

- Some limitations of this data set are the inclusion of data from 1970. 
- Another limitation is lack of granularity on country data when drilling down into the data. 
- In addition, plays were not analyzed for success relative to subject matter or tone. It could be that some types of plays attracted either a greater number of backers, or, attract higher individual donation amounts.

- We could include the same charts here included, but that limit data to productions in the US only, for further clarity. 

- Charts showing the average donation and number of backers within successful play campaigns in the US would be helpful in further refining the number of donor and average donation goals. Louise needs a clear idea of the number of people she needs to get to write a check, and how much the average check should be for.
